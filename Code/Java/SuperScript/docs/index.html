<h3>Features</h3>
        <p>SuperScript uses <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf">Apache BSF</a> to provide scripting support for 20+ scripting languages. Using SuperScript you get one interface to your scripting language of choice without leaving jEdit.</p>
		<p>SuperScript adds several "default" objects namely view, buffer, editPane, textArea and superscript. Most of you conversant with jEdit would be familiar with these variables. "view" refers to instance of the Current View(JFrame). "buffer" is the active buffer. "editPane" &amp; "textArea" to the current EditPane and JEditTextArea objects respectively. "superscript" variable refers to the current SuperScript plugin instance to script SuperScript itself.

		<br><br>
		Version 0.4 makes SuperScript jEdit 4.2 complaint.
		<br>

		<p>SuperScript enables support for writing macros for jEdit in all languages supported by SuperScript. On a fresh install SuperScript does not know which language the user wants to write macros in (obviously), thus if you want jEdit to recognize macros written in languages other than say Beanshell then you have to first enable macro language support from Global Options-SuperScript, And select the Scripting language of the macros you want jEdit to recognise - Click OK and restart jEdit. If you store your macros in ${jedit.home}/macros or ${user.home}/.jedit/macros directory or any of its sub-directory then after restarting, you will see your macros in jEdit's Macros Menu. You can also write startup scripts in SuperScript supported languages. Checkout jEdit's Help for details on how and where to store startup scripts.</p>
<br>
<h3>Usage</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
			After installing SuperScript, dock the SuperScript dockable on one of the four sides or maybe keep it floating as per your taste.</li>
			<li>Download the scripting Engine of your choice from their respective project sites.(some have been metioned below) and place the jars in <jedit.home>\jars or <user.home>\.jedit\jars directory, where <jedit.home> is where you installed jEdit and <user.home> is your home directory.</li>
			<li>Select any language you intend to script in from the Languages dropdown.</li>
			<li>To evaluate any expression like 2+2 or print "Hello World" etc, type it out in the textbox provided in the dockable. The results/errors (if any) will be printed out in the Output window.</li>
			<li>To run an existing script open the file in jEdit and click "Execute Script" button in the Dockable. You could also write and test a script without saving it by the same means.</li>
			<li>If you want jEdit to run macros written in SuperScript supported languages then follow the procedure explained in the "Features" section above. </li>

<h3>Where to download the Scripting Engines</h3>
<p>You will find most of them <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/projects.html">here</a>. There are a few upcoming scripting languages which SuperScript can support via Apache BSF. They are <a href="groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a>, <a href="http://objectscript.sourceforge.net">ObjectScript</a>, etc. Please look at respective scripting language website for details on enabling SuperScript to recognise and use them.</p>
